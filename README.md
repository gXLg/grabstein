Here I post my GRA homework solutions
to share with friends.

# GRA
GRA - "Grundlagepraktikum: Rechnerarchitektur"
(Basic Internship in Computer Architecture),
is a subject in the second semester of the
Bachelor Computer Science degree at the
Technical University Munich ([TUM](https://tum.de)).

# Homework
The published homework will have
different categories based on how they
are graded and my opinion.

The assignments for the published homework
are the property of the chair's instructors.
I do not claim any rights for the assignments.

# Plagiarism
To prevent plagiarism, my solutions
will only be posted one day after the
homework deadline.

Do not copy any code from here.
Rather than that, just read it
and learn something for yourself
and future homeworks.

after the end of the 2024 Summer Semester.
